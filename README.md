## Description
There's no need to stake/unstake tokens, The token will be generated to owners and can be simply claimed.</br>

Two types of tokens Bulls and Bears. Each will generate a certain amount of WSDM Token. </br>

Bulls are %10 of the population and Bears are %90. Don't Dare to ask me why. hint: The market is not doing well so the bulls seem to to be winning.</br>

Bear generate WSDM (I am realy bad at naming) consistently, then every once in while, the bulls will steal their hard earned Money just like the market.</br>

WSDM can be staked to earn token through the staking contract. </br>
